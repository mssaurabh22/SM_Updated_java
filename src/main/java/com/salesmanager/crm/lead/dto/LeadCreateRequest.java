/**
 * Step-1-friendly creation: only companyName/contactPerson/contactNo/(cityId or cityOther)/
 * (leadSourceId or leadSourceOther)/(industryId or industryOther) are required, matching a
 * quick "just capture the basics" flow - everything else can be filled in later via
 * LeadUpdateRequest. Note: requirements was added here even though it's absent from the field
 * enumeration in the Phase 2 spec - it's a real column in V3__leads.sql and leaving it
 * unreachable via the API looked like an oversight rather than an intentional omission.
 *
 * industryId/businessTypeId/leadSourceId/designationId/stateId/cityId/interestLevelId each have
 * a "creatable" free-text *Other counterpart, for a value the operator typed because it isn't
 * yet in master data - the two are mutually exclusive (LeadService#create enforces this via
 * MasterDataService#validateCreatableField); productsOther is a supplementary free-text note
 * alongside productIds, not an either/or fallback, so it has no such pairing rule.
 * industryId/leadSourceId/cityId are no longer {@code @NotNull} here - each is required unless
 * its *Other counterpart is supplied instead (also enforced in LeadService#create).
 *
 * {@code logAsVisitToday} (Phase 3): when true, the touchpoint that led to creating this Lead
 * is itself logged as a completed Visit dated today (see LeadService#create /
 * visit.LeadVisitEventListener). Defaults to false/omitted - no such Visit is created.
