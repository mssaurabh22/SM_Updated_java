/**
 * Owns invoice_number_counters' lock/increment logic in isolation, for testability. Keyed by
 * (organizationId, year) - see V12__invoicing.sql's comment for why this is a plain
 * SELECT...FOR UPDATE row lock inside the caller's existing transaction (TenantFilter already
 * wraps the whole request in one), NOT scheduler.AdvisoryLockRunner - that guards whole
 * scheduled-job executions across instances, not a per-row business-counter increment.
 *
 * <p>Must be called from within the SAME transaction as the rest of InvoiceService#create, so
 * the row lock is held for the invoice's entire creation (preventing two concurrent invoices
 * in the same org+year from ever allocating the same number), and released automatically at
 * that transaction's commit/rollback.
